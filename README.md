1. Extract the project files attached in the email (e.g., `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`) into the same directory.
2. The provided `.env` file contains the required environment variables. If needed, you can create your own `.env` file using the same format.
3. You can find the full project [here](https://github.com/triliadis/currency-calculator).
